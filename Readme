# Teamwork Task

This repository now includes a simple console Tic Tac Toe game.

## Tic Tac Toe

Run the game with Python 3:

```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py
```

Two players take turns entering numbers 1-9 that correspond to the board
positions. The first player to get three in a row wins; otherwise the
game ends in a draw when the board is full.
